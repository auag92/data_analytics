The Assignment has been solved primarily in octave.

However, the least square fits(using levenberg algorith) were carried out in
gnuplot using the 'fit' command.

As such, datafiles were generated (script$.dat) and the gnuplot instructions and
results re reported in the gnuplot_fit_script$.dat files.
