The Assignment has been solved primarily in octave.
However, the least square fits(using the Levenberg algorithm) were carried out in
Gnuplot using the 'fit' command.
As such, datafiles were generated (script$.dat) and the gnuplot instructions and
results were reported in the gnuplot_fit_script$.dat files.

script1:  solution to the first problem

x and y coordinates of mars in a heliocentric cartesian coordiate system were
calculated and squares of coordinates were exported to datafile.

function optimised:-> y^2 = -x^2 +r^2
w.r.t parameter r
gnuplot> f(x) = -x + r;
gnuplot> fit f(x) "script1.dat" us 1:2 via r

The resultant value of r is displayed on the running the script along with the
error.

script2:  solution to the second problem

theta : zodiac independant heliocentric longitude of Mars/ Earth determined as
      theta  = (zodiac_index - 1)*30 + angle(from data file)
phi   : the heliocentric latitude of mars calculated using radius determined in previous problem.

Normal vector to a hypothetical orbital plane is define as n = (a,b,1) and the function
 (n<dot>r) is minimised where is 'r' is the position vector of Mars of on the celestial sphere.
Having determined a and b using regression on the above relation, the angle of declination is determined as
arc_cosine of the dot product of unit vector along plane normal and the z axis.

script3:  solution to the third problem
